Giudelines for creating datasets/datafiles

What is considered as a "dataset"?
How do I choose datasets out of my data?
What data format should I consider to publish, xlsx, csv, ... 
What structure should my file have, which charset, ...?
Are there any seals or norms I should or could use?
What if I want to publish RDF and LOD - do you propose ontologies?

Sorry didn't know where to place this.
